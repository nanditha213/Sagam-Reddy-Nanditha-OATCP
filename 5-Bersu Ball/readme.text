It takes two inputs, n and m, representing the sizes of two arrays.
It reads the elements of the first array a[] of size n.
It reads the elements of the second array b[] of size m.
It sorts both arrays a[] and b[].
It initializes a variable pairs to count the number of pairs of elements that satisfy the condition.
It iterates through each element of array a[] and checks against each element of array b[] to find pairs where the absolute difference between elements is less than 2.
If such a pair is found, it increments pairs and marks the element of array b[] as 'visited' by assigning a value of 1000 (this is arbitrary, just to mark it as visited).
It breaks out of the inner loop after finding such a pair, as each element of a[] can form a pair with at most one element of b[].
Finally, it prints the count of pairs.
This problem is similar to the Bersu Ball problem where you have two sets of boys and girls, and you want to form pairs such that the age difference between a boy and a girl in a pair is at most one.

In this code:

Array a[] represents one set (e.g., boys).
Array b[] represents another set (e.g., girls).
The algorithm iterates through each boy (a[] element) and tries to find a suitable girl (b[] element) such that the age difference is at most one.
If such a girl is found, a pair is formed, and that girl is marked as visited to avoid pairing her with another boy.
Finally, the code prints the count of pairs formed.
So, this code essentially implements a greedy algorithm to find pairs of elements from two sets such that the absolute difference between them is less than 2, which is the essence of the Bersu Ball problem.
