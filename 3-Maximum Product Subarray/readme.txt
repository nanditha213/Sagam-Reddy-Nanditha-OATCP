This code snippet is an implementation of the maximum product subarray problem. Let's break down what it does:

It takes an input n representing the size of the array.
It reads n integers into a vector nums.
It initializes two variables ans and a to store the maximum product.
It then iterates through the array once from left to right and once from right to left, calculating the product of subarrays.
At each step, it updates the ans and a variables with the maximum product encountered so far.
Whenever the product becomes zero, it resets the product to 1 because multiplying by zero will always result in zero, hence breaking the subarray.
Finally, it compares the maximum products obtained from left to right and right to left iterations and prints the maximum of the two.
This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum product subarray by scanning the array only twice, achieving a time complexity of O(n).
