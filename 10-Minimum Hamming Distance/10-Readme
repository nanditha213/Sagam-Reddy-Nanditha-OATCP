This C++ code implements a solution to calculate the total Hamming distance of an array of integers.

Headers and Constants: The code includes <bits/stdc++.h> header which is a convenient way to include most standard headers in a single line. It also defines a ll macro for long long int.
Class Solution:
The class Solution contains a single public method totalHammingDistance.
This method takes a vector of integers nums as input and returns an integer representing the total Hamming distance.
Inside the method, if the input vector nums is empty, it immediately returns 0.
Total Hamming Distance Calculation:
It initializes an array bits of size 32 (assuming integers are represented using 32 bits) and fills it with zeros.
Then, for each integer n in the input vector nums, it iterates over each bit in n using bitwise operations.
For each bit position i, it increments bits[i] by 1 if the corresponding bit in n is set.
After processing all integers in nums, it calculates the total Hamming distance by iterating over the bits array and adding bits[i] * (k - bits[i]) to the answer, where k is the size of the input vector nums.
Main Function:
Reads the number of integers n from the input.
Reads n integers into a vector nums.
Creates an instance of Solution class and calls its totalHammingDistance method with the input vector nums.
Prints the result.
Time Complexity:
The solution has a time complexity of O(n * 32), where n is the number of integers in the input vector nums. This is because for each integer, it iterates over its 32 bits to update the bits array.
Overall, the time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input vector nums.
Space Complexity:
The solution uses an additional array bits of size 32 to store the count of bits at each position, resulting in constant space complexity with respect to the input size.
