This C++ code aims to generate all possible brief words from given strings. A brief word is a word obtained by taking a substring of length at most 4 from the original word. Let's break down the approach:

Headers and Macros:
The code includes the <bits/stdc++.h> header, which includes most standard C++ headers.
It defines macros for long long and a modulo value.
Function briefWords:
This recursive function generates all possible brief words from a given string str.
It takes parameters:
str: the input string.
s: the current substring being formed.
i: the current index in the input string.
n: the remaining length of the substring to be formed.
If n becomes 0, it means the desired length of the substring is formed. It adds the substring s to the result vector res and returns.
If i reaches the end of the string, it returns an empty result vector.
Otherwise, it recursively calls itself twice:
Once by adding the current character at index i to the substring s and decreasing n by 1.
Once by not adding the current character to the substring and keeping n unchanged.
It concatenates the results obtained from both recursive calls and returns the final result vector.
Main Function:
Reads the number of strings n from the input.
Initializes an empty set ss to store unique brief words.
Initializes an empty 2D vector ans to store the brief words for each input string.
Iterates over each string:
Reads the string s from the input.
Initializes an empty vector temp to store brief words for the current string.
Iterates from 1 to 4 (inclusive) to generate brief words of lengths 1 to 4.
For each length, it calls the briefWords function to generate brief words and adds them to temp if they are not already present in the set ss.
Adds temp to ans.
Prints each vector of brief words.
Time Complexity:
The time complexity mainly depends on the number of strings n and the length of each string.
The recursive briefWords function explores all possible substrings of lengths 1 to 4, so its time complexity is exponential in the worst case.
Overall, the time complexity is high due to the recursive nature of the algorithm.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity depends on the number of strings n and the length of each string.
Additional space is used to store brief words in sets and vectors.
The space complexity could also be high due to the recursive calls and the stack space used by the program.
