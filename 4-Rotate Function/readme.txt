It takes an input n representing the size of the array.
It reads n integers into a vector nums.
It initializes variables sum to keep track of the sum of all elements in the array and original to keep track of the sum of i*nums[i].
It iterates through the array and calculates both sum and original. For each element nums[i], it adds nums[i] to sum and i*nums[i] to original.
After the initial iteration, it sets maximum equal to original.
Then, it iterates through the array in reverse order, simulating the rotation of the array from right to left.
In each iteration, it updates original by subtracting nums[i]*n from sum (which effectively removes the contribution of nums[i] from the original sum and adds the contribution of (n-1)*nums[i] to original), simulating the rotation.
After each rotation, it updates maximum with the maximum value between original and maximum.
Finally, it prints the maximum value, which represents the maximum sum of i*nums[i] after all possible rotations.
This code essentially rotates the array one element at a time from right to left and calculates the sum of i*nums[i] after each rotation. Finally, it finds the maximum sum obtained among all rotations and prints it out.

So, if you're relating this to a rotate function, you could think of each iteration in the reverse loop as representing a rotation of the array to the left by one element, and then calculating the sum of i*nums[i] for that rotation.
