This C++ code aims to count the number of subgrids in a given grid where all elements are 1. 

Function countSubgrids:
It takes a 2D vector grid as input, representing the grid where elements are either 0 or 1.
It first determines the size of the grid (size), assuming the number of rows and columns are equal.
It initializes a vector rowBits of size size to store the bits representing each row of the grid.
It then iterates over each row of the grid:
For each element in the row, it bitwise ORs the element's value shifted left by (size - j) positions with the corresponding element in rowBits[i]. This operation sets the j-th bit of rowBits[i] to 1 if the grid element is 1.
After processing all rows, rowBits[i] represents the bits corresponding to row i, with the j-th bit being set to 1 if the j-th column of row i contains a 1.
Counting Subgrids:
It initializes a variable subgridCount to count the number of subgrids with all elements as 1.
It then iterates over pairs of rows in the grid (i, j) where i < j:
It calculates the number of common bits between rowBits[i] and rowBits[j] using the __builtin_popcount function, which counts the number of set bits in an integer.
It calculates the number of pairs of indices (k, l) within these common bits using the formula pairsCount = commonBits * (commonBits - 1) / 2. This formula counts all possible combinations of selecting 2 indices from commonBits indices.
It adds pairsCount to subgridCount.
Main Function:
Reads the size of the grid from the user.
Reads the elements of the grid from the user, populating the grid vector.
Calls the countSubgrids function with the grid as input.
Prints the result, which is the number of subgrids with all elements as 1.
Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where n is the size of the grid. This is because it iterates over all pairs of rows in the grid and performs constant-time operations within each iteration.
Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(n), where n is the size of the grid. This is due to the rowBits vector, which stores the bits representing each row.
